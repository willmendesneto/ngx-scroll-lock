## Why scroll lock?

The idea of this component is make the process of locking the page scroll transparent and easier. So the main point is integrate this component with other tooling process, such as:

- When open a modal component
- Open a hamburguer menu
- Any other that you like :)

It's totally transparent for you and you can integrate easier in your application, improving your user experience ðŸŽ‰

## Demo

Try out our [demo on Stackblitz](https://ngx-scroll-lock-sample.stackblitz.io)!

## Install

You can get it on NPM installing `ngx-scroll-lock` module as a project dependency.

```shell
npm install ngx-scroll-lock --save
```

## Setup

You'll need to add `NgxScrollLockModule` to your application module. So that, the `<ngx-scroll-lock>` components will be accessible in your application.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    YourAppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    NgxScrollLockModule,
    ...
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [YourAppComponent]
})

export class YourAppComponent {}

```

After that, you can use the `featureToggle` components in your templates, passing the configuration data into the component itself.

- `ngx-scroll-lock`: Handle the scroll lock of your app;

```html
<ngx-scroll-lock lock="true"> </ngx-scroll-lock>
```
